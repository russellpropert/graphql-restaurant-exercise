# Holy Grail Layout

## Description
This is a GraphQL API demo. It can be used with Postman, but it also has its own interface. The queries and mutations in restaurant_queries.txt can be used to demonstrate the API's functionality.  

## How To Run
[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) is required to run.

Run in a local folder by running the following commands:  
npm install  
npm start  

To use the GraphQL interface, use your web browser to navigate to http://localhost:5500/graphql. The same address can be used for Postman.
